# Employee Management Application using Hibernate

## Overview

This is an Employee Management Application developed using **Java**, **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**, and **Hibernate**. The application allows users to manage employee records, including adding, displaying, updating, and deleting employee details. The application leverages Hibernate as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for database interactions, ensuring smooth CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with a relational database.

## Features

- **Add Employee**: Adds a new employee to the database.
- **Display Employees**: Lists all employees stored in the database.
- **Update Employee**: Allows for the modification of an existing employee's details.
- **Delete Employee**: Deletes an employee from the database.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for the application logic.
- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: Used for building dynamic web pages.
- **Hibernate**: ORM framework used for database operations.
- **Servlets**: Used to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **MySQL** (or other relational database): Used as the backend database.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the front-end layout and styling.
- **Apache Tomcat**: Web server for deploying the JSP application.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- **JDK 8+**: Java Development Kit (JDK) for running Java programs.
- **Apache Tomcat 8+**: A servlet container to run the JSP pages.
- **MySQL Database**: Or any other relational database to store employee data.
- **Hibernate**: The ORM framework for interacting with the database.
- **Maven**: For building and managing dependencies (optional, if you're using Maven).
